# HANSI

**HANSI** is a HANS character sheet for the **I**nternet. For a similar project written in C, look [here](https://github.com/nmke-de/HANS-CharacterSheet). For a demo, take a look [here](https://nmke-de.github.io/HANSI).

### What is HANS?

HANS is a tabletop roleplaying system, much like Dungeons and Dragons, Call of Cthulu or Broken Compass, but setting agnostic like GURPS, FATE or HowToBeAHero.
<!-- TODO write more about HANS here. -->
The acronym "HANS" stands for "Hundertseitige Attribute Nutzendes System", which is German and means "System using hundred-sided attributes".

Please note that the attribute names, among other things, are currently only available in German.

## But why?

Because it was requested by someone I know.

## Deployment

Currently, HANSI is in early development, which means that the process described below may not be functional yet.

1. Copy the files of this repository to your website, retaining the directory structure.
